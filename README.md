## Objective:
* Introduction to Machine Learning fundamentals.
* Understand the difference between traditional machine learning and Deep Learning.
* Able to Build, Train, and Test a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch.
* Learn to use libraries and framework for implementing Deep CNN architectures.
* Collaboratively Analyze, design, implement and test solutions to real-world computer vision related problems.

## Assessment Items
* **Assignment-1 (Individual) Tasks:**
  1. Implement a simple kNN classifier for digit classification
  2. Implement a Linear classifier using SVM for digit classification
  3. Implement a Linear classifier using Neural Network for digit classification
  4. Compare the three implementations in terms of classification accuracy and top choices.

* **Assignment-2 (Individual) Tasks:**
  1. Customize AlexNet/GoogleNet/ResNet and reduce/increase the layers. Train and test on images
  2. Implement a custom CNN architecture for object detection and localization.
  3. Train and test the custom architecture on a given dataset for detection of multiple Objects, using Faster RCNN or Yolo object detection methods.
(Training, validation and testing datasets will be provided.)

* **Assignment Task 3: Project (Group) (Optional):**
Task:  Any one of the following problems, or any combination:

  1. Design/Implement an image classification algorithm. 
  2. Design/develop an object detection system for detecting specific objects in a video and localizing them.
  3. Develop a clear problem statement that is within the capabilities of CNNs and design and capture a dataset of significant size that addresses this problem.
  4. Compare a series of algorithms against each other to determine optimum performance, and then suggest new approaches that improve performance.
  5. Develop a user interface that allows the operational use of an algorithm to achieve a real-world
